Welcome to Uno's Game Dev Journal. My name is James, I’m a Indie Games Developer, and this blog is designed not only to be a site of updates on my work, but also as a repository for developers: Here you’ll find my tips, tricks, and thoughts.

Quick facts about me:

– My family was sent on many postings when I was young, so I've grown up all over the world (Kenya, Dublin, New Dehli, Beijing and Abu Dhabi). I currently live in Cheltenham, UK.

– I graduated with a First from the University of Gloucestershire in 2021.

– As an Intern, I worked for a special needs school and developed communication aids for Children with Cerebal Palsy. I hope to bring the lessons from my experience into the games I develop.
