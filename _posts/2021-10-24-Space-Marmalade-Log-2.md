Let's talk about game accessibility.

---

A large number of modern games aren’t very accessible to disabled users. Many gamers with disabilities will need internal or external tools to play the game. It makes sense to make games accessible, whether you’re someone making (more people get to play my game!) or selling games (more people are going to buy my game!). So why aren’t more games accessible?

One possible explanation is the factors of game development. The further a game is along in production, the harder it is to make sweeping changes to a game's initial design. If “tacked on” at the last minute, implementation can be sloppy. (Looking at games with tiny subtitles.)

Also, there's a broad variety of accessibility needs someone might need to play a game. Trying to catch everything can become an endless task. Not to mention, this spends resources that could be improving the game.

With these two ideas in mind, we can draw some ideas on how to approach developing accessible games. 

1. Games that factor accessibility early are more likely to produce something useful. In fact, games that factor accessibility into their hook and premise are more likely to stand out. (Looking at titles like “The Vale”).

2. Developers need to pick specific access needs, rather than “a bit of everything”. When spread too thin, the risk is making tools that appear useful when they actually aren’t. For this reason, it’s good to test throughout the design process. (Especially with testers living with the specific disability)

These are the principles I want to take into my development of Space Marmalade.  Having developed for motor disabilities, it made sense to work on what I'm familiar with. Even within this category, there’s a large range of features to consider. Alternatives for fast reaction times, re-bindable controls, etc. 

For this reason, I decided early on that I'd make a game that relied on turn-based mechanics. Chess, D&D and Pokémon are good examples.

Turn-based games happen to be one of my most favourite genres of games. 

Writing this article, I realise I can attribute this favoritism to the hardware I was limited to when I was younger. Playing games that required quick mouse control was impossible on my crappy laptop, so I was naturally drawn to games that were slow and methodical.

This is another important incentive to invest in accessible game design. Even fully-accessible users will find accessiblity features essential, from time to time. Whether it's because they're restricted to one hand after an injury, or need subtitles because of ongoing background noise. (There's a lot that can be written on this subject, I'll have to save it for another post!)  

Over time, I've discovered different external tools designed to help use software. These range from external buttons, eye-tracking, and tubes you can blow into. These translate input into computer commands using a middleware software. 

I remember a particular software used for controlling Skype. It'd keep the software window open, and translate input into Skypes keyboard shortcuts. Users could make calls without Microsoft having to make the features themselves. 

To my surprise, Skype had removed a large amount of shortcuts from their most recent version. This meant that users depending on them to use an outdated version of Skype. Another reason to maintain good accessibility standards!

Anyway, back to Space Marmalade...

My game was first pitched for mobile, so I wanted to make the game cursor-driven. Game commands given through the mouse, while avoiding secondary buttons. (Such as right-click and mouse wheel). This reduced the scope of controls that the game could actually use. Less scope means less features that need developing, which can be a positive. Yet it may become unwieldy as I introduce new controls, such as map-zooming.

Accessibility in games is something worth making an effort for. Approaching accessibility as a creative challenge can lead to new technical innovations. I also think it’s important to not become so wrapped up in development that we lose sight of our end goal.

For these reasons, I'll continue to explore and expand the principles I've discovered. I hope that as the game progresses, I'll be able to introduce new innovations like eye-tracking. I also hope that players will take notice, that the game will find an audience that needs it. As the game approaches the testing phase, I'll be sure to reach out to these communities for their input.

I hope someone finds this article interesting and/or useful. Next time I'll try to go into more depth about what Space Marmalade is actually about!
