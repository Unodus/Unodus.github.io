## Space Marmalade Log, 07/10/2021

Space Marmalade is a game in development, my passion project. At the time of writing, it has been almost a year since the conception of the game. I've discovered one small roadblock,  unfortunately. In a nutshell, making games is very hard.

---

My name is James, though on the internet I go by "Uno". In my defence, it has been a very busy year. During the year of lockdown, I finished University, got my first job and moved out of the home. 

I am a game developer (at least, aspiring to be). I have at least one published mobile game (it got taken down). I work full time in a programming role (as a contractor).

My hope is not to come across as whiny with these logs. I want to document my development because of the game dev's I am inspired by. Randy, GMTK, Jonas, Sebastian League, to name a few. By sharing my struggles, I'd like to blaze a trail for developers after me.

With all that in mind... Why is making a game hard?

As I write this, I am reminded of a quote I picked up when vising a games exhibition at the  V&A museum.

"Making games combines everything that's hard about building a bridge with everything hard about composing an opera. Games are operas made out of bridges." - Frank Lantz, 2014

The first thing to unpack is bridges. Like an incomplete bridge, an unfinished game is of no real value to a user (except as an example of what not to do).

Second, operas need an orchestra. This is relevant to games because making games requires many specialized skills. Programming, art, audio... These don't even begin to scratch project management and marketing. You can't play all the instruments at once, you need a band.

Third thing is, balancing the product for the opera-listener and the bridge-walker. A game has to be fun and engaging, while also being tidy and functional. These are not exclusive concepts, but the exact balance will differ from user to user. No matter how perfect, there will always be room for improvement. 

In short, the three "rules" for difficulty-free game development are:
1. Have attainable goals. 
2. Don't work alone, have a team.
3. Be open to player criticism.

It's no surprise that game jam teams who embrace these concepts can produce amazing work.

Watch as I proceed to do none of these things.

1. Space Marmalade has had the same goals for months, with little progress to show for it.
2. We do have a team at the moment. I'm thrilled at the prospect of working with veterans Chase Bethea and Manovermars. Yet, the project as it stands is in a position where it's hard for the team to put their work in. In other words, I need to finish my framework before the team can work. I'm also aware that there is no funding for this project, something unsustainable for any team that can't subsist on game-dev passion alone.
3. Space Marmalade is still very early in development. It has no trailer, no demo, nothing for a user to offer feedback on. This isn't something I can offer yet, but this blog might give me an early avenue to crucial feedback.

On that cheerful note, it's 1 AM in the morning for me and I need to sign off. In the next log I'll try talk more about the game concept itself, my progress with it, and what remains to be done.
