## A new Hope [Space Marmalade Log 1] 

Space Marmalade is a game in development, my passion project. At the time of writing, it has been almost a year since the conception of the game. I've discovered one small quaundry. In a nutshell, making games is very hard.

In my defence, it has been a very busy year! During the year of lockdown, I finished University, got my first job and moved out of the home. 

I am a game developer. I've worked on several game project, having published at least one mobile game. I work full time as a programmer. This means I've got a pretty solid set of game development skills and experience to back me! 

I want to document my development because of the game dev's I am inspired by. Randy, GMTK, Jonas, Sebastian League, to name a few. By sharing my struggles, I'd like to blaze a trail for developers after me, as well as keep up my own momentum.

With all that in mind... Why is making a game hard?

As I write this, I am reminded of a quote I picked up when vising a games exhibition at the  V&A museum.

"Making games combines everything that's hard about building a bridge with everything hard about composing an opera. Games are operas made out of bridges." - Frank Lantz, 2014

The first thing to unpack is bridges. Like an incomplete bridge, an unfinished game is of no real value to a user (except as an example of what not to do).

Second, operas need an orchestra. This is relevant to games because making games requires many specialized skills. Programming, art, audio... These don't even begin to scratch project management and marketing. You can't play all the instruments at once, you need a band.

Third thing is, balancing the product for the opera-listener and the bridge-walker. A game has to be fun and engaging, while also being tidy and functional. These are not exclusive concepts, but the exact balance will differ from user to user. No matter how perfect, there will always be room for improvement. 

In short, the three "rules" for difficulty-free game development are:
1. Have attainable goals. 
2. Don't work alone, have a team.
3. Be open to player criticism.

It's no surprise that game jam teams who embrace these concepts can produce amazing work.

So, how does Space Marmalade measure up?

1. Space Marmalade has been making steady progress, trying to hit milestones for each #ScreenshotSaturday to generate interest in the game
2. We do have a team at the moment. I'm thrilled at the prospect of working with veterans Chase Bethea (Game Music Composer) and Manovermars (Artist).
3. Space Marmalade is still very early in development. It has a few video clips, a gamejam submission, and a discord to offer feedback on. Additionally, this blog might become a new avenue for feedback.

When I started this blog entry, I sent an initial draft to my girlfriend and close friends. The feedback I got back was, it was far too negative! I glossed over a lot of my accomplishments, focusing on what the game didn't have. It was definitely cathartic to get a lot of the worries on my mind on paper. Yet when I read back, I realized what I had written was very from the actual truth (which is why it should now read much nicer!).
 
I was feeling an aversion to my game, not because I stopped enjoying it, but because of a constant stress. This is stress I've put on myself, wanting to do the best for my game and succeed.

In my mind, this is the hardest part of game development. We want our games to be good. We put a lot of thought into what the game needs to be good, and when we should be there. When we fall short, it's easy to fall into a cycle of analyzing why. "Am I not working hard enough?", "Have I not been passionate enough?", "Is there something more I can do?"

Burnout is commonplace in our industry, and I suspect this connects to how long games take to develop. I can draw a piece of art in a day, put down the pen, and think "I'm happy with that" or "I'm not happy with that". I would struggle to work on the same piece of art for over a year in the same way. 

In a way, keeping this log forces me to confront the mindset I'm in. To be honest with myself, rather than pressing on regardless. I hope as I work my way through, I'll be able to find and share the answers that help me overcome these challenges!
