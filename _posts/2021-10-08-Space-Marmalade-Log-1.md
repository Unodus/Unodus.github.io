## Space Marmalade Log, 07/10/2021

Space Marmalade is a game in development, my passion project. At the time of writing, it has been almost a year since the conception of the game. I've discovered one small roadblock,  unfortunately. In a nutshell, making games is very hard.

---

In my defence, it has been a very busy year! During the year of lockdown, I finished University, got my first job and moved out of the home. 

I am a game developer. I've worked on several game project, having published at least one mobile game. I work full time as a programmer. This means I've got a pretty solid set of game development skills and experience to back me! 

I want to document my development because of the game dev's I am inspired by. Randy, GMTK, Jonas, Sebastian League, to name a few. By sharing my struggles, I'd like to blaze a trail for developers after me, as well as keep up my own momentum.

With all that in mind... Why is making a game hard?

As I write this, I am reminded of a quote I picked up when vising a games exhibition at the  V&A museum.

"Making games combines everything that's hard about building a bridge with everything hard about composing an opera. Games are operas made out of bridges." - Frank Lantz, 2014

The first thing to unpack is bridges. Like an incomplete bridge, an unfinished game is of no real value to a user (except as an example of what not to do).

Second, operas need an orchestra. This is relevant to games because making games requires many specialized skills. Programming, art, audio... These don't even begin to scratch project management and marketing. You can't play all the instruments at once, you need a band.

Third thing is, balancing the product for the opera-listener and the bridge-walker. A game has to be fun and engaging, while also being tidy and functional. These are not exclusive concepts, but the exact balance will differ from user to user. No matter how perfect, there will always be room for improvement. 

In short, the three "rules" for difficulty-free game development are:
1. Have attainable goals. 
2. Don't work alone, have a team.
3. Be open to player criticism.

It's no surprise that game jam teams who embrace these concepts can produce amazing work.

So, how does Space Marmalade measure up?

1. Space Marmalade has been making steady progress, trying to hit milestones for each #ScreenshotSaturday to generate interest in the game
2. We do have a team at the moment. I'm thrilled at the prospect of working with veterans Chase Bethea (Game Music Composer) and Manovermars (Artist).
3. Space Marmalade is still very early in development. It has a few video clips, a gamejam submission, and a discord to offer feedback on. Additionally, this blog might become a new avenue for feedback.

In the next log I'll try talk more about the game concept itself, my progress with it, and what remains to be done!
